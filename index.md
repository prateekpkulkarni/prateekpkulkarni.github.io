I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at [PES University](https://www.pes.edu/), Bengaluru, India, pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a specialization in VLSI and Quantum Technology. My research interests center around the capabilities and limits of quantum computers, and computational complexity theory more generally.


## Current Research
- Working with [Prof. Sumit K Mandal](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~skmandal) at IISc on the realizability of multicore quantum computing architectures.
- Previously worked with [Prof. Sivasankar M](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1802/) on some problems in combinatorics on words (enumerating/locating factors/subwords).

## Reviewing & Service
- [IEEE CONECCT 2025](https://ieee-conecct.org/)

## Teaching
- Teaching Assistant, Quantum Transport and Logic Gates (Spring 2025)
- Teaching Assistant, Quantum Entanglement and Quantum Computation (Fall 2025)
