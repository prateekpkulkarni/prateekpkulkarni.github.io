# Prateek's Research Hub

## Overview

Welcome to my hub! I am a passionate engineering student with a keen interest in the areas of quantum computing and machine learning. This will serve as a space where I share my thoughts, achievements, research and anything fun/interesting that I come by! You can also find projects that I have worked on earlier, the ones I am currently and my academic positions. Feel free to get in touch/drop an email if you wanna discuss about anything! 

## About Me

I am a 2nd-year Electronics Engineering student pursuing my BTech at [PES University](https://pes.edu) with an inclination towards _Signal Processing_ and _Control Systems_, however I also like various aspects of VLSI (on the lines of device physics and the like). I love to work on anything that has the words "quantum" and "machine learning" in them -- I really am a chaotic researcher in that respect. I like to work on a wide range of topics and usually I like to find naive intersections of well-established fields. For more on this, please see my projects! I also watch a ton of TV shows, anime and am a voracious book reader (not meaning to boast -- but I have a small collection of about ~4.5k books at my place!)

## Research Interests

My primary research interests lie in the following areas:

- Quantum Computing and Information Theory
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Cryptography
- Control Systems

However, often I find myself thinking in analogies and my attention span lasts so long that it is apt to say my _hop count_ tends to infinity! XD
Usually my research directions span two or multiple of these areas. I believe interdisciplinary research not only reveals several aspects that couldn't be anticipated but also give us new sound foundational understanding of the fields themselves.

## Current Positions

### **Post-Quantum Cryptography Intern** | C-ISFCR, PES University 

Was awarded one of the 10 internships at the Center for Information Security, Forensics and Cyber Resilience at my University that involves rigorous research into the principles of quantum/post-quantum cryptography and developing supporting algorithms and techniques.

- Started Jan. 2024! 


### __Research Student__ | _IIT Tirupati_

I am fortunate to be working with Prof. S Aravinda at Department of Physics, IIT Tirupati on various aspects of Quantum Causlity and it's applications. Recently, I was joined by Priyanuj Rajbongshi (yay!) who's pursuing his PhD at IIT Tirupati. 

- Started Oct' 2023
- [Prof. Aravinda's webpage](https://www.quantaravinda.com/)


### __Research Intern__ | _PES University_ 

- Working with [Dr. Rashmi N Ugarakhod](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vUzJA6MAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Dept. of ECE at my University!
- The focus is on investigating aspects of autonomous control systems with inherent machine learning frameworks.

Apart from my advisors, I feel fortunate to recieve guidance from [Prof. R Srikanth](https://ppisr.res.in/r-srikanth/), [Prof. R Vasudevan Iyer](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1164/), [Prof. Sumit Kumar Mandal](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~skmandal/) and [Hrishikesh Haritas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrishikesh-haritas-58b435228/) amongst others!


## Projects

###  __Field-Induced Isomorphic Optimization Algorithms__

Developed a new class of optimization algorithms which shares in philosophy similar spirits to the Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms (NIOAs). FIIOs induces a property-preserving field for the dataset, and exploits the nature of the field itself to extract desired solutions. It is a visually-powerful and elegant way of looking at optimizing problems with vast potential applications.

- It's just a thought now and I am just beginning to work on it! Write to me if you're interested!

###  __RegDyno.Ai__

Co-founded a company that offers a robust predcition model, and aims at reducing noises and errors in a time-series data plot drastically with introduction of a new regression model that uses a custom probability distribution. Currently focused on satellite-relevant data, we are under the process of finishing the framework. The company was pitched as a part of the PESU Venture Labs Any Body Can Create (PVL-ABC) challenge, drawing attention from IP lawyers and investors.

- [Check Back Soon!]

### __MyMath__

Built a fully functional advanced [scientific calculator](https://github.com/psykick05/MyMath), with high precision using Python, (team of 3) for my first semester Python mini project.

## Publications

### Recreational 

1. A Non-Rigorous Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for Some Special Cases
   - This [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28449.38242) presents a non-rigorous geometric analysis of Fermat's Last Theorem for specific cases where _n_ is even and for when _n_ is odd but _x_, _y_, and _z_ are          perfect squares.

2. Investigating Factorial Sums and their Connection with the Laplace Transform
   - This [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.19396.40329) presents a formula for the sum of first _n_ factorials, and also establishes a closed-form for the sum of consecutive gamma functions.

## Workshops and Conferences

### __Present and Future Computing Systems__ | Jan. 2024

- Was one of the ~80 invited/selected [participants](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~skmandal/data/final_list_of_attendees.pdf) in the [workshop](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~skmandal/Outreach.html) organized by the Dept. of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science. 
- The workshop included talks on several aspects of computing systems (including but not limited to HPC, Supercomputing, GPUs, Heterogeneous systems), current research forefront and a hands-on demonstration of DIRâ€“V VEGA Processor, India's indigenous microcontroller development board, by the C-DAC.

  
## Education

Not only did KV expose to me to a ton of opportunities but the environment really infused a research-driven enthusiasm. Besides, the vibrant lush-green campus with lots of open space always set an ideal atmosphere to be in!
 

## Awards and Honors

### __Explain the Concept__ | IISc. 2019

- Won the Second prize, nationally, in _Explain The Concept_ event at the Undergraduate Fest organized by Indian Institute of Science, while in high-school (I was in my 9th grade!).  
- The event consisted of picking a relatively complex topic, in sciences or mathematics, and trying to explain it to a layman audience in a very accessible and interactive manner.

I have always found teaching to be a very enjoyable pursuit -- and as a (~ an _obvious_) result, I strongly intend to pursue a professorship in my future and establish my very own research group!

### __Basketball__
- I am a huge fan of both spectating and playing basketball. I have played professionally for a while in my high-school days! I still continue to ball when I can! :)
- Since the time I got into basketball and NBA, I have been a constant supporter of Golden State Warriors! (Go Warriors!)

### __Trekking__
- I love trekking, off-road cycling. It doesn't fail for once to feel overwhelming and proud to have conquered peaks, and yet realise how minuscule we stand to them!
