# Prateek's Research Hub

## Overview

Welcome to my hub! I am a passionate engineering student with a keen interest in the areas of quantum computing and machine learning. This will serve as a space where I share my thoughts, achievements, research and anything fun/interesting that I come by! You can also find projects that I have worked on earlier, the ones I am currently and my academic positions. Feel free to get in touch/drop an email if you wanna discuss about anything! 

## About Me

I am a 2nd year Electronics Engineering student pursuing my BTech at [PES University(https://pes.edu)] with an inclination towards Signal Processing and Control Systems, however I also like various aspects of VLSI. I love to work on anything that has the words "quantum" and "machine learning" in them -- I really am a chaotic researcher in that respect. I like to work on a wide range of topics and usually I like to find naive intersections of well-established fields. For more on this, please see my projects!
