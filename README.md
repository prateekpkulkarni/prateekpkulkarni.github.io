# Prateek's Research Hub

## Overview

Welcome to my hub! I am a passionate engineering student with a keen interest in the areas of quantum computing and machine learning. This will serve as a space where I share my thoughts, achievements, research and anything fun/interesting that I come by! You can also find projects that I have worked on earlier, the ones I am currently and my academic positions. Feel free to get in touch/drop an email if you wanna discuss about anything! 

## About Me

I am a 2nd year Electronics Engineering student pursuing my BTech at [PES University](https://pes.edu) with an inclination towards Signal Processing and Control Systems, however I also like various aspects of VLSI. I love to work on anything that has the words "quantum" and "machine learning" in them -- I really am a chaotic researcher in that respect. I like to work on a wide range of topics and usually I like to find naive intersections of well-established fields. For more on this, please see my projects!

## Research Interests

My primary research interests lie in the following areas:

- Quantum Computing
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Cryptography
- Control Systems

However, often I find myself thinking in analogies and my attention span lasts so long that it can be described as: 
$$
\lim_{{t \to \infty}} Hop Count = \infty
$$
Usually my research directions span two or multiple of these areas. I believe interdisciplinary research not only reveals several aspects that couldn't be anticipated but also give us new sound foundational understanding of the fields themselves. After all, that's how nature works, right? 

## Current Positions

### __Long-Term Research Intern__ | _IIT Tirupati_

I am fortunate to be working with Prof. S Aravinda at Department of Physics, IIT Tirupati on various aspects of Quantum Causlity and it's applications. Recently, I was joined with Priyanuj Rajbongshi (yay!) who's pursuing his PhD at IIT Tirupati.

## Projects

### Project 1: __Field-Induced Isomorphic Optimization Algorithms__

Developed a new class of optimization algorithms which shares in philosophy similar spirits to the Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms (NIOAs). FIIOs induces a property-preserving field for the dataset, and exploits the nature of the field itself to extract desired solutions. It is a visually-powerful and elegant way of looking at optimizing problems with vast potential applications.

### Project 2: __RegDyno.Ai__

Co-founded a company that offers a robust predcition model, and aims at reducing noises and errors in a time-series data plot drastically with introduction of a new regression model that uses a custom probability distribution. Currently focused on satellite-relevant data, we are under the process of finishing the framework. The company was pitched as a part of the PESU Venture Labs Any Body Can Create (PVL-ABC) challenge, drawing attention from IP lawyers and investors.

### Project 3: __MyMath__

Built a fully functional advanced [scientific calculator](https://github.com/psykick05/MyMath), with high precision using Python, (team of 3) for my first semester Python mini project.

## Publications

### Recreational 

1. A Non-Rigorous Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for Some Special Cases
   - This [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28449.38242) presents a non-rigorous geometric analysis of Fermat's Last Theorem for specific cases where _n_ is even and for when _n_ is odd but _x_, _y_, and _z_ are          perfect squares.

2. Investigating Factorial Sums and their Connection with the Laplace Transform
   - This [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.19396.40329) presents a formula for the sum of first _n_ factorials, and also establishes a closed-form for the sum of consecutive gamma functions.

## Workshops and Conferences

# Workshop 1: __Present and Future Computing Systems__

- Was one of the ~80 [participants](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~skmandal/data/final_list_of_attendees.pdf) in the [workshop](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~skmandal/Outreach.html) organized by the Dept. of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science. 
- The workshop included talks on several aspects of computing systems (including but not limited to HPC, Supercomputing, GPUs, Heterogeneous systems), current research forefront and a hands-on demonstration of DIRâ€“V VEGA Processor, India's indigenous microcontroller development board, by the C-DAC.
