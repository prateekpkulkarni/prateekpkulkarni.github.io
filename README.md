# Prateek's Research Hub ‚öõ

## Overview ‚òÑÔ∏è

Welcome to my hub! I am a passionate engineering student with a keen interest in the areas of [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). This will serve as a space where I share my thoughts, achievements, research and anything fun/interesting that I come by! You can also find projects that I have worked on earlier, the ones I am currently and my academic positions. Feel free to get in touch/drop an email if you wanna discuss about anything!

## About Me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I am a 2nd-year Electronics Engineering student pursuing my BTech at [PES University](https://pes.edu) with an inclination towards _Signal Processing_ and _Control Systems_, however I also like various aspects of VLSI (on the lines of device physics and the like). I love to work on anything that has the words "quantum" and "machine learning" in them -- I really am a chaotic researcher in that respect. I like to work on a wide range of topics and usually I like to find naive intersections of well-established fields. For more on this, please see my projects! I also watch a ton of TV shows, anime and am a voracious book reader (not meaning to boast -- but I have a small collection of about ~4.5k books at my place!) As [ErrantScience](https://twitter.com/ErrantScience/status/1748314606370488510?t=N0H2GWXOGdIq8Rfv0gMmMg&s=19) rightly puts it (XD)!


## Research Interests üìë

My primary research interests lie in the following areas:

- Quantum Computing and Information Theory
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Cryptography
- Control Systems

However, often I find myself thinking in analogies and my attention span lasts so long that it is apt to say my _hop count_ tends to infinity! XD
Usually my research directions span two or multiple of these areas. I believe interdisciplinary research not only reveals several aspects that couldn't be anticipated but also give us new sound foundational understanding of the fields themselves.

## Current Positions üìå

Apart from my advisors, I feel fortunate to recieve guidance from [Prof. R Srikanth](https://ppisr.res.in/r-srikanth/), [Prof. R Vasudevan Iyer](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1164/) and [Prof. Sumit Kumar Mandal](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~skmandal/) amongst others!


## Projects üìí

###  __Field-Induced Isomorphic Optimization Algorithms__

Developed a new class of optimization algorithms which shares in philosophy similar spirits to the Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms (NIOAs). FIIOs induces a property-preserving field for the dataset, and exploits the nature of the field itself to extract desired solutions. It is a visually-powerful and elegant way of looking at optimizing problems with vast potential applications. 

To better understand it, or to get a flavor of it, look at the following illustration. Consider the famous [Brachistochrone Problem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BrachistochroneProblem.html). In the figure below, one always ends up choosing the hypotenuse to be the fastest path for the ball -- but Nature has other plans! Due to gravity, there's a path (the curve right below it) that comes out even quicker than the intuitively fastest path. This curve is called the _Brachistochrone_ curve. There's an amazing [Vsauce video](https://youtu.be/skvnj67YGmw?si=mod1PtcM44JJ6Jdg) you could watch on it! So coming back, how can we use this idea to find a cool way to optimize? We start by defining a (currently) ambiguous isomorphic mapping of an input data set in such a way that its configuration might change but it is strictly property-preserving. Then the idea is to fake-induce a gravity field (currently I have no idea how -- we'll get there but yeah), so that among all paths possible there exists a brachistochrone of sorts which will give us the "fastest" solution. This could have implications in several areas of active research! But this is just one of 'em -- mimicking observations of Nature could never be complete in itself.

It's just a thought now and I am just beginning to work on it! Write to me if you're interested!

###  __RegDyno.Ai__

Co-founded a company that offers a robust predcition model, and aims at reducing noises and errors in a time-series data plot drastically with introduction of a new regression model that uses a custom probability distribution. Currently focused on satellite-relevant data, we are under the process of finishing the framework. The company was pitched as a part of the PESU Venture Labs Any Body Can Create (PVL-ABC) challenge, drawing attention from IP lawyers and investors.
