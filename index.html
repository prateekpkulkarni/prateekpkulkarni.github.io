<p>I am a 2nd-year Electronics Engineering student pursuing my BTech at PES University with an inclination towards Signal Processing and Control Systems, however I also like various aspects of VLSI (on the lines of device physics and the like). I love to work on anything that has the words "quantum" and "machine learning" in them -- I really am a chaotic researcher in that respect. I like to work on a wide range of topics and usually I like to find naive intersections of well-established fields.</p>

      <ul>
        I'm heavily interested in quantum computing and information theory, machine learning, control systems, and network-on-chip architectures. <br>
         However, often my attention span lasts so long that it is apt to say my hop count tends to infinity! Usually my research tends to span two or multiple of these areas. <br><br>
