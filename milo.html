            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>MILO (Memory-Informed Latency Optimization) is an innovative project aimed at optimizing instruction scheduling to mitigate pipeline stalls caused by cache misses in RISC-V architectures. This project seeks to integrate advanced predictive algorithms with dynamic instruction reordering techniques to significantly enhance pipeline efficiency and reduce latency.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the groundbreaking work of Onur Mutlu, MILO adopts principles of predictive and proactive optimization. It leverages techniques similar to those employed in Mutlu’s research to address memory and performance inefficiencies, applying them specifically to instruction scheduling within RISC-V pipelines.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Inspiration and Background</h2>
            <p>Onur Mutlu’s contributions to memory system optimization have been seminal in advancing computer architecture. Notable projects such as RowClone, TL--DRAM, RAIDR, and SALP have provided critical insights into improving memory access and latency. These innovations have laid the groundwork for MILO’s approach.</p>
            
            <h3>RowClone</h3>
            <p>RowClone addresses memory access inefficiencies by accelerating row-wise operations in DRAM. While primarily focusing on memory efficiency, the principles behind RowClone’s optimization techniques are foundational for understanding how MILO aims to enhance pipeline performance.</p>

            <h3>TL--DRAM</h3>
            <p>Targeted Latency DRAM (TL--DRAM) improves DRAM access times by specifically targeting latency issues. Although TL-DRAM enhances memory performance, it does not directly tackle instruction-level scheduling problems, which MILO aims to address.</p>

            <h3>RAIDR</h3>
            <p>Row Access Incremental Deep Refresh (RAIDR) reduces the overhead associated with DRAM refreshes, indirectly impacting latency. RAIDR’s approach to managing memory refresh cycles offers valuable lessons for optimizing cache performance in MILO.</p>

            <h3>SALP</h3>
            <p>Selective Access Latency Prediction (SALP) focuses on predicting memory access latency, a concept closely related to MILO’s cache miss prediction. SALP’s techniques provide a basis for developing MILO’s predictive mechanisms and understanding their implications for pipeline performance.</p>

            <h3>Contributions:</h3>
            <p>MILO differentiates itself by integrating predictive cache miss handling with dynamic instruction reordering. This approach not only addresses limitations of existing methods but also aims to achieve a more comprehensive improvement in pipeline performance.</p>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>MILO’s primary objective is to enhance the performance of RISC-V pipelines by predicting cache misses and dynamically reordering instructions to avoid pipeline stalls. The project will utilize the Ripes simulator to model and test these optimization techniques within a realistic RISC-V architecture.</p>

            <h3>Key Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cache Miss Predictor:</strong> Utilizes a miss history buffer to predict future cache misses based on past access patterns, thereby improving prediction accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Instruction Reorder Buffer:</strong> Manages and reorders instructions to prioritize execution based on cache miss predictions, minimizing stalls.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Fetching Mechanism (Extension):</strong> Introduces speculative data loading strategies to further reduce latency by preemptively loading data into the cache.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Predictor (Extension):</strong> Combines cache miss prediction with branch prediction to address multiple performance bottlenecks concurrently.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> Updates the predictor based on real-time outcomes to continuously improve prediction accuracy and adapt to varying workloads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementation in Ripes Simulator</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Setup Ripes Environment:</strong> Configure the Ripes simulator with a RISC-V architecture model that supports the necessary pipeline stages and memory hierarchy.</li>
                <li><strong>Simulate Cache Access Patterns:</strong> Use Ripes to simulate various workloads and collect data on cache access patterns, which will inform the development of the cache miss predictor.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop Cache Miss Predictor:</strong> Implement the predictor within Ripes, incorporating algorithms for predicting cache misses based on historical access data.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Instruction Reorder Buffer:</strong> Integrate the reorder buffer into the Ripes simulation, enabling dynamic reordering of instructions based on predictions from the cache miss predictor.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement Pre-Fetching Mechanism (Extension):</strong> Extend the simulation with speculative pre-fetching techniques to load data in advance and measure their impact on performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop Hybrid Predictor (Extension):</strong> Combine cache miss prediction with branch prediction in Ripes, assessing the effectiveness of this hybrid approach in optimizing pipeline performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate and Refine:</strong> Use Ripes to evaluate the performance improvements achieved through MILO, refine algorithms based on feedback, and iterate to achieve optimal results.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Evaluation and Metrics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stall Cycles:</strong> Measure the reduction in pipeline stalls due to cache misses before and after implementing MILO.</li>
                <li><strong>Instruction Throughput (IPC):</strong> Assess improvements in instructions per cycle to gauge the effectiveness of MILO.</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction Accuracy:</strong> Evaluate the accuracy of cache miss and hybrid predictors using metrics such as precision and recall.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Fetching Impact:</strong> Analyze the effect of pre-fetching on cache hit rates and overall system performance.</li>
            </ul>
